# Liri Node App

Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface or LIRI is a command line app that has the ability to find song information, find movies, find bands in town, and do actions from a text file. The spotify-this-song command takes advantage of the spotify NPM package to find song information. The movie-this command takes advantage of the OMDB NPM package to find movie information. The bands-in-town command takes advantage of the twitter NPM package to find bands playing. The do-what-it-says command has the ability to run any of the commands previously defined on this page.  However, instead of accepting arguments, the do-what-it-says command reads what to do from a text file located within the repository.
